> Back when Windows XP shined on the market and computer games were sold attached to newspapers my first challenge began. It was just me against a game installation guide. Since that moment my curiosity and passion about computer games and how they work started growing. Unluckily, programming wasn't part of the educational program in that moment. For that reason, my first software encounter was with MIT AppInventor while on high school. Later on, I started my studies as a software engineer. Currently, in my last year, I am looking to expand my knowledge in the field of software.
